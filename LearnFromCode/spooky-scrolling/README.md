# Spooky Scrolling

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/0x00Ditto/pen/RwvgJoK](https://codepen.io/0x00Ditto/pen/RwvgJoK).

This is a second take on my previous pen whic was similar, but way too resource intensive for the CPU. So I re-made the way I render things, this time with the GPU. It's a work in progress! 

Still have a lot more coming with this pen. Goal is to make it scrollable.
